# Factorial Experiments

**Input:** *{x,y: z}* coordinates where *{x,y}* are independent variables, whilst *z* is the dependent one.

In this case, we are strictly speaking of factorial data in the "two independent - one dependent" variable sense. There is a page dedicated to plotting [multi-dimensional](./multidimensional.md) data spaces. In this specific case, it is hard to top the representation of the data in density, contour plots or heatmaps.

## Density/Contour Plot (2D and 3D)

A natural way to show the way two independent variables correlate with one another is through a heatmap. In these cases, is the data are sufficiently continuous across the experiments cells, creating a density or countour plot might be a good way to show the results of an experiment.
