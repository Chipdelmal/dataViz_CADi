# Transitions Data

**Input data:** Transition matrices/Edges lists

Information about transitions is easily represented in different formats. In terms of information transmission contexts, it is customary to represent the data in a network form. In biological contexts, however, these data are more traditionally shown in heatmaps or chord diagrams. It is, therefore, a good practice to be comfortable with representing data in these three formats, as it might give some additional insight to patterns, and correlations.

## Network

Some of the most commonly used packages are: [D3](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/disjoint-force-directed-graph)

## Chord Diagram

Frequently used in genetic analyses. Some common packages that are widely used to generate them are: [circos](http://www.circos.ca), [D3](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/d3-chord-diagram), [circlize (R)](https://beta.observablehq.com/), [plotly (python)](https://plot.ly/python/filled-chord-diagram/).
