Data visualization is, ultimately, a tool to aid our narratives. Wether it is a scientific paper, a lecture, a talk, or an internal report; there is always an audience we want to convince, and a story we want to tell.

## Constraints

There's always tradeoffs we have to take into account when generating graphics for scientific/engineering contexts, and depending on our application we should be able to weight which elements are more important for our specific purposes.

###  Utility VS Attractiveness

Increasing the level of abstraction usually tends to improve the aesthetics of visualization. This can be achieved by removing labels, and elements that might interfere with the graphics, but it comes at the cost of information.
