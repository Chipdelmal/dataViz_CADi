# dataViz CADi

This repository contains the materials for the "Data Visualization" one week intensive [CADi](http://sitios.itesm.mx/va/capacitacion/1_2.html) (["Cursos de Actualización en las Disciplinas"](http://sitios.itesm.mx/va/capacitacion/1_2.html)) course taugh at ["Tecnológico de Monterrey"](https://tec.mx/es) on December of 2018 at Campus Estado de México.

This is a compendium of materials and activities designed to develop and improve skills to make charts and plots more interactive/appealing, and to show some of the tools we can use to achieve better exposure of our work in scientific, and engineering applications.

## Requirements

Although not strictly required, having some knowledge on one of the following programming languages is suggested:

* [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/): Most of the examples in this course were developed in this platform due to its flexibility in terms of graphical capabilities.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/): One of the most popular programming languages. Some of the more versatile data visualization frameworks are compatible with it.
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/): A popular statistical framework with lots of community support.

It is also suggested to have the [atom](https://atom.io/) text editor for the markdown and python examples. Some useful packages for development in atom are:

* [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced): Allows the live update of markdown documents previews.
* [Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen): Package that allows running Python code in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)-style from within atom.
* [Preview HTML](https://atom.io/packages/atom-html-preview): Allows us to view the results of our HTML within atom.
